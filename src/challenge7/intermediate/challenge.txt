Write a program that draws a recursive image.
For example, a Sierpinski triangle , a Barnsley fern , or a Mandelbrot set fractal  would be good drawings.
Any recursive image will do, but try to make them look fun or interesting.
Bonus points for adding a color scheme!
Please post a link to a sample image produced by your program, and above all, be creative.
