We'd like to write a list of people, ordered so that no one appears in the list before anyone he or she is less smart than.
The input will be a list of pairs of names, one pair per line, where the first element in a pair names a person smarter than the person named by the second element of the pair. That is, each input line looks like:
smarter-person : less-smart-person
