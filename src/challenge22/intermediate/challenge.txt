One of my favorite projects for beginners is to make a 2D (top down) maze style game using text to represent the map and the player. 
Print out a 20x20 (or whatever size floats your boat) grid of characters where '#' characters represent impassible walls, and spaces or '.' characters represent empty passable spaces. 
Draw the player in place of one of the passable characters as a + sign, or some other distinct character. 
Every time the player presses an arrow key, check and see if the adjacent grid square is a passable square. 
If so, update the player's position and reprint the 20x20 map with the + sign in the new position.
