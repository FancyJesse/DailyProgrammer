An employer wants you to store some information about his employees in an easy to read list form.
He wants you to input the names, ages, and the pay of his employees.
Unfortunately, he is terrible with computers, and he'll call you in every time he wants to change something he's going to call you in, unless you add an easy way to edit the information.
